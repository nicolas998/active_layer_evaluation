# Active Layer Evaluation



This repo contains the codes and the data used to perform the evaluation of the active layer and tile drainage equations developed for the HLM model. 
> 01:Active layer evaluation.    - Overall differences including KGE and Pbias.
    - Peak flow differences magnitude and timing. 
> 02:Tile and distributed tile setups evaluation.    - Overall differences.
> 03:spatial differences of some of the analyzed metrics.    - KGE, Pbias, Qpeak Dif, Lag.
> 04:Exploring the limits of our new approach.    - Evaluation of the performance using different parameters on the active layer setup.
    - Determine regions in which our approach has limits.
